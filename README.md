# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is the simple game rock-paper-scissor, at first steps will functial only with user input in promt line.
The main goal- of course, create new game logic from scratch, but also became more adjusted to pseudocoding, along the way.
In some time this game will be rewritten and will be supplemented with DOM manipulations, interactivity and design.
